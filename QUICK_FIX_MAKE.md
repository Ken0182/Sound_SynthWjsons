# Quick Fix for Make Command Issue

## Problem
```
make: cmd.exe: No such file or directory
make: *** [Makefile:165: cmake_check_build_system] Error 127
```

## Root Cause
CMake generated a Makefile that expects `cmd.exe` (Windows command prompt), but you're using MSYS2 which uses Unix-style commands.

## Solution 1: Use mingw32-make (Recommended)
```bash
# Instead of 'make', use 'mingw32-make'
mingw32-make -j4
```

## Solution 2: Install make properly
```bash
# Install make for MinGW
pacman -S mingw-w64-i686-make

# Then try again
make -j4
```

## Solution 3: Use ninja (Alternative)
```bash
# Go back to parent directory
cd ..

# Remove build directory
rm -rf build/

# Create new build directory
mkdir build
cd build

# Configure with ninja generator
cmake .. -G "Ninja" -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release

# Build with ninja
ninja
```

## What This Means
✅ **The jsoncpp fix worked!** - No more string_view linker errors
✅ **CMake configuration succeeded** - All dependencies found
⚠️ **Only issue**: Make command compatibility

## Expected Result
After using the correct make command, you should see:
- Compilation of source files
- Linking of libraries
- Creation of `aiaudio_generator.exe`
- No linker errors

## Try This First
```bash
mingw32-make -j4
```

This should complete the build successfully!

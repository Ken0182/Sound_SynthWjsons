# One-Click Sound Pipeline - Formal Objectives

## Executive Summary

The One-Click Sound pipeline unifies the existing Python semantic engine (`AudioPresetGenerator`) with the C++ audio rendering system (`AIAudioGenerator`) to create a seamless preset-to-playback experience. This document defines the architecture, user stories, and success criteria for the integrated system.

## Architecture Overview

```
JSON Preset → Python Semantic Engine → C++ Audio Renderer → Audio Output
     ↓              ↓                        ↓
  Tile Click → Semantic Search → Real-time Audio → Browser/Desktop
```

### Core Components

1. **Python Pipeline** (`AudioPresetGenerator`)
   - Preset parsing and normalization
   - Semantic search and embedding generation
   - Policy application and decision making
   - DSP graph building

2. **C++ Engine** (`AIAudioGenerator`)
   - Real-time audio rendering
   - DSP processing and optimization
   - Quality assessment and monitoring
   - Low-latency audio output

3. **Bridge Layer** (pybind11)
   - Python ↔ C++ data exchange
   - Threading and memory management
   - API contract enforcement

4. **Web Interface** (React/Vite)
   - Preset grid visualization
   - Real-time audio controls
   - Performance monitoring

## User Stories

### Primary User Stories

1. **As a music producer**, I want to click on a preset tile and hear the sound immediately, so I can quickly audition sounds during production.

2. **As a sound designer**, I want to search for presets by semantic description (e.g., "warm pad", "aggressive bass"), so I can find the right sound without browsing through hundreds of presets.

3. **As a live performer**, I want to trigger sounds with minimal latency (< 10ms), so I can use the system in real-time performance.

4. **As a developer**, I want to build the system with a single `make all` command, so I can easily set up the development environment.

### Secondary User Stories

5. **As a user**, I want to see real-time performance metrics (CPU usage, latency), so I can optimize my system for the best performance.

6. **As a content creator**, I want to export rendered audio as WAV files, so I can use the sounds in other projects.

7. **As a system administrator**, I want the build system to work on both Linux and Windows (MSYS2), so I can deploy the system across different environments.

## Technical Requirements

### Latency Requirements

- **Target Latency**: < 10ms from click to audio output
- **Maximum Latency**: < 50ms for acceptable user experience
- **Buffer Size**: 64-512 samples (1.4-11.6ms at 44.1kHz)

### Performance Requirements

- **CPU Usage**: < 80% on modern hardware during real-time playback
- **Memory Usage**: < 2GB for typical preset library (1000+ presets)
- **Concurrent Sounds**: Support 8+ simultaneous audio streams

### Quality Requirements

- **Audio Quality**: 44.1kHz, 16-bit minimum, 48kHz/24-bit preferred
- **Semantic Accuracy**: > 85% user satisfaction with search results
- **Stability**: < 1% audio dropouts during normal operation

## Shared Responsibilities

### Python Side Responsibilities

- **Preset Management**: Loading, parsing, and validating JSON presets
- **Semantic Processing**: Embedding generation, similarity search, ranking
- **Policy Application**: Role-based parameter adjustments

## MSYS2 Compatibility Notes

### Required Dependencies

- **MinGW-w64**: C++ compiler and runtime
- **CMake**: Build system configuration
- **Python**: 3.8+ with pip package manager
- **pybind11**: Python-C++ binding library
- **Audio Libraries**: PortAudio, ASIO (Windows), ALSA (Linux)

### Build Configuration

- Use `MinGW Makefiles` generator for CMake
- Set `CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH` to MSYS2 installation
- Configure Python paths for MSYS2 Python installation
- Handle Windows-specific audio driver requirements

### Known Issues

- Path separators: Use forward slashes in CMake files
- Library linking: Ensure proper DLL loading on Windows
- Audio drivers: May require ASIO4ALL for low-latency audio
- Python paths: MSYS2 Python may have different module paths

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Foundation (Week 1)
- Create objectives document and get team approval
- Set up pybind11 build system
- Implement basic Python-C++ bridge
- Create shared data schema

### Phase 2: Integration (Week 2)
- Implement preset-to-audio pipeline
- Add real-time audio rendering
- Create web API endpoints
- Test basic functionality

### Phase 3: Optimization (Week 3)
- Optimize latency and performance

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks

- **Latency Issues**: Implement audio buffer management and threading optimization
- **Memory Leaks**: Use RAII patterns and smart pointers in C++
- **Cross-platform Issues**: Test on both Linux and Windows early and often
- **Audio Driver Issues**: Provide fallback audio engines and clear setup instructions

### Project Risks

- **Scope Creep**: Stick to defined user stories and success criteria
- **Integration Complexity**: Start with simple bridge and iterate
- **Performance Requirements**: Set realistic targets and optimize incrementally
- **Team Coordination**: Use clear documentation and regular check-ins

## Conclusion

The One-Click Sound pipeline represents a significant integration effort that will provide users with a powerful, real-time audio generation system. Success depends on careful attention to latency requirements, robust cross-platform support, and seamless integration between Python and C++ components.

The defined success criteria provide clear, measurable goals for the project, while the phased implementation approach ensures steady progress toward the final deliverable.

# Debug: String View Issue Still Persisting

## Problem
Even though we applied the `std::string()` fix, the linker is still getting string_view errors:
```
undefined reference to `Json::Value::isMember(std::basic_string_view<char, std::char_traits<char> >) const'
```

## Analysis
The issue might be that the compiler is still binding to string_view overloads despite our explicit `std::string()` calls. This can happen if:

1. **Template instantiation**: The compiler might be instantiating templates that use string_view
2. **Implicit conversions**: Some other part of the code might be causing string_view binding
3. **Header issues**: The jsoncpp headers might be forcing string_view usage

## Possible Solutions

### Solution 1: Force String Overloads with Variables
Instead of inline `std::string()` calls, use variables:

```cpp
// Instead of:
if (root.isMember(std::string("stages"))) {

// Use:
const std::string stages_key = "stages";
if (root.isMember(stages_key)) {
```

### Solution 2: Check for Other JSON Usage
There might be other places in the code using JSON that we missed.

### Solution 3: Use Different JSON Library
Consider switching to nlohmann/json which has better C++17 support.

### Solution 4: Compiler Flags
Try adding compiler flags to disable string_view:
```bash
-D_GLIBCXX_USE_CXX11_ABI=0
```

## Next Steps
1. Try Solution 1 first (using variables)
2. Search for any other JSON usage we missed
3. If that doesn't work, consider Solution 3 (different JSON library)
